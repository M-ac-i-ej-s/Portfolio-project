## Hello, this is my portfolio project :)

## How to set it up:

1. In the main folder run **docker-compose up** command to start your keycloak application.
2. Enter the backend folder by typing **cd backend** in the console, then install dependecies by typing **npm i**.
3. Then create a new file called **.env** and enter the data passed by me.
4. After steps 2 and 3 are done u can type **node index.js** to start the backend server.
5. Now go back by typing **cd ..** and enter frontend folder **cd frontend**.
6. Install the dependecies **npm i** and after its finished run the server by entering in the console **npm run dev**.
7. Done : )

## Admin panel:

By manually entering the /admin route in the browser, its going to redirect you to the keycloak login page, you need to enter the admin credentials which in our case
are login: admin, password: admin.

Now you should be able to edit the page through brower.
